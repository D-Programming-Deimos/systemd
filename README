systemd D bindings
------------------

Introduction:

Reference implementation of a few systemd related interfaces for
writing daemons. These interfaces are trivial to implement. To
simplify porting we provide this reference implementation.

The following functionality is provided:
* Support for logging with log levels on stderr
* File descriptor passing for socket-based activation
* Daemon startup and status notification
* Detection of systemd boots
